# 2nd-HW-Challenge

##Description

My motivation throughout creating this project was to create a professional looking portfolio for myself that represents my coding skills. I built this project so that other people and emplyers can view my fully functional portfoliio of all my projects so that they could potientially employ or reach out to me. By creating this portfolio is it easier to access projects, know more about the web developer, and also know how to contact the web developer; essentially makes the hiring process more efficient. I learned many different tools throughout the creation of my portfolio. I firstly learned how to put opacity on images in the flexbox when the user hovers over the image, I also learned how to add images into flexboxes, I also learned how to include the flex container, also flexboxes inside the flex container. These are just some things I have learned in the creation of my portfolio, I hope to learn even more when creating future projects.

##Usage
 The use of this Portfolio 

 1. Clicking the items in the navbar will bring you to that specific section 
 2. About Me section will some information about me (Piero Rodriguez)
 3. Work section is where all the project will be; as you hover the boxes the opacity will lower; the text inside the boxes are links to where the projects will be but instead I put the link to my github account since I have not done any projects which I can include my portfolio yet.
 4. The Contact Me section is where you can see my phone number, my email which is linked to the outlook homepage to where the emplyer can send me an email, and you can also see Github text which is linked to my Github profile homepage.
